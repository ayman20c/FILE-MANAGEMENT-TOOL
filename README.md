Internship Provider: CodTech

ðŸ‘‹ Introduction  
For my first task during the CodTech internship, I had to build a small project using C++ based on the concept of file handling. I decided to create a simple file manager tool that lets the user write, append, and read content from a text file. The whole program is written in C++ and helped me understand how file handling actually works in real-world scenarios.

ðŸ›  Project Overview  
This is a console-based program where the user gets a menu to choose from. Based on the choice, the program performs different file operations.

â¿¡ *Write to File* â€“ This option clears whatever content was already in the file and writes new content.  
â¿¢ *Append to File* â€“ This option adds new lines to the end of the file without deleting the old data.  
â¿£ *Read from File* â€“ This reads all the text from the file and displays it line by line on the screen.  
â¿¤ *Exit* â€“ This simply exits the program.

The file name used in the project is my_file.txt. It is created or updated in the same folder where the code is executed. I used the fstream library and worked with ofstream, ifstream, and file modes like ios::app to implement these features.
 How I Learned It  
To learn the concepts, I watched a few C++ tutorials on YouTube that explained file handling in a very simple way. I also checked articles and examples on GeeksforGeeks and W3Schools to understand the syntax and logic. I didnâ€™t just copy-paste anything â€” I first understood how things work and then wrote the code myself. I faced a few issues at first but managed to fix them by trial and error and reading documentation.
 How the Code Works  
The program starts by showing a menu and asking the user to select an option (1 to 4). Each option is linked to a specific function:
- writeToFile() â€“ for writing new content
- appendToFile() â€“ for adding more content at the end
- readFromFile() â€“ for reading and displaying file content

The program keeps running in a loop until the user selects the Exit option. Iâ€™ve also handled wrong inputs using cin.clear() and cin.ignore() to avoid crashes or infinite loops.

 What I Learned  
This task helped me understand how files are handled in C++. I learned how to create a file, how to write and append data, and how to read it back using file streams. I also got better at using functions, loops, and conditions to make the code more organized and readable. Most importantly, I gained confidence in writing code on my own without direct help.
